How are you even supposed to argue this topic?\n\nThe coach said something about the effect on society that rape has, but I really do not understand it. I would be grateful if someone could help me understand if this motion really can be argued or is just absolutely unfair to prop side.",

There can be value in using lopsided resolutions in a practice setting when accompanied by significant guidance/teaching from the coach. 2. *This* resolution's weakness is that is it offensive and inappropriate, not that it is one-sided.\n\nI don't know if this is simply an example of a coach exercising extremely poor judgment in selecting a practice topic or if it's part of a pattern of something more troubling, but I would (at minimum) inform your parents about this assigned topic and find a way to alert a school administrator. Someone in a position of authority needs to inform the coach that this isn't okay and must never be repeated.",

(Psychology about how all humans are crazy)\n\nIs it the governments place to regulate rape?\n\nDo human rights exist?\n\nEtc.\n\nThat said though, this is a bad example because, well the one sided topic is offensive and inappropriate, not extactly groundless",

Or say that rape is the term used to describe the colonization of africa and say this house is china, and that the BRI is a new form of colonialism. Use definitions to your advantage and run a fact debate saying its not about good or bad, but what will or wont. Furthermore, you can argue that it's so outrageous to argue for rape that the framer must be arguing for a fact, etc.\n\n  \nThat doesn't mean what your coach did was acceptable. I would talk to admin if it made people uncomfortable because the spirit of debate is education and accessibility.",
