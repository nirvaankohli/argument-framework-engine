      "text": "How to deal with disrespectful opponents?\n\nI joined speech and debate this year and I'm doing public forum debate. It was my first tournament yesterday and somehow, we went 5-0 and we broke and won octafinals as well.\n\nBut, when we got to quarterfinals I fumbled my rebuttal a bit (my points were good but i struggled to get them out smoothly) and recovered a good amount in final focus. We did end up losing that round 2-1, however, my friends who were spectators told me that our opponents were supposedly laughing and rolling their eyes during my final focus.\n\nOne of our debate captains told me that we could do something about that because it's a form of disrespect and not proper debate. I was wondering if anyone who's more experienced could tell me what I should've done in that situation?\n\nLike would I tell the judges post-debate or what?",

But even if I give a disrespectful opponent a win, I\u2019ll mention it on the ballot. I\u2019d suggest you just stay classy and do your best!\n\nWhen I was in high school doing LD, as a senior I was on a solid winning streak and I remember in a preliminary round I hit a really inexperienced debater who was bad. His arguments were basic and he was struggling. I just did my thing, and the judge awarded my opponent the win, and on the ballot he said I was over-confident and dismissive of my opponent\u2019s points. It stuck with me (this was almost 30 years ago and I still remember it), and after that I made sure to be as gracious as possible no matter who I was debating. A good life lesson.",

      "text": "It's better to learn to take it on the chin. The judges will notice, and dock them points for it, and refer to it in their feedback. Their coach will then see this.\n\nIf they show disrespect before the end, you can maybe drop in a passive aggressive mention of it in your summary or final focus,\n\n\"Our opponents missed our point on free trade, probably because they were too busy laughing instead of listening, so you should consider that a dropped contention and recognise our win there.\"\n\nComplaining in an attempt to get a win because of ill discipline on the part of your opponents will not be viewed positively, generally speaking. They'll ask the judges, who will say they didn't see it or that it wasn't as bad as you (or your teammates) said. Use their ill discipline to your advantage instead.\n\nAlso, don't let it get to you. Many teams use... let's say confident looking body language as a strategy. Speak to your opponents both before and after debates (especially if it gets super heated) and say something positive. That always gets good feedback from judges to coaches, and often reveals that a lot of the apparent negativity or aggression you've seen is part of an act or strategy.\n\n-\n\nI've seen a debater physically tower over one of my own teams during cross after they struggled to find their evidence quickly enough. \n\n\"Let me see your laptop, it'll save time.\" \n\n&lt;Girl proceeds to walk over, tower over a seated opponent, who looked terrified&gt;\n\nI thought it was an excellent, if risky, way to shake an opponent. After the debate was over, she was super nice and full of positive things to say, even though she was attempting to fray the nerves of her opponent. Obviously an act, from a kid that's pleasant in other situations.\n\nMy team that were affected by this made a point of learning from it, and went on to plan for such eventualities and strategies being used against them. They didn't get upset about it but worked out what to do to counter it.",

Best case is that the judge already noticed this behavior and took it into account and/or will report it themself, so your piling on looks petty and in the vein of a sore winner. Worst case, you've misinterpreted your opponent's behavior and the judge thinks it was innocuous/reasonable, so you are being vindictive and whiny without any basis. In the middle, the judge didn't see what your opponents did but you calling it out is still whiny because it's not part of the merits of what you're arguing and you have no idea whether they were paying attention to your speech or not. \n\nIf you have a strong point that your opponent drops, just call out the drop. Don't waste your time speculating *why* your opponent dropped it, especially if you'd be delivering insults/personal attacks to do so. This isn't a roast.",

Focus on your own preparation and integrity and recognize it is not your role to police the poor behavior of your opponents. If your opponents are behaving rudely, that is a gift to you, and all you have to do to receive that gift is to be authentically respectful and demonstrate excellence and integrity. Judges will almost always dock their speaks and give you a little more grace. It is possible to still lose the round on the flow, but over time, this is the way. Really good teams don't engage in this behavior - they just win the round and earn respect.",

Also, feel free to let it fuel you a little. Next time you see this team in out-rounds make it a 3-0 in your favor, and that will be all the revenge you need. \n\nThe judges likely saw the behavior, and some of them may have noted it in their ballots. Also, coaches talk. I had a student tell me one of their opponents was playing video games during one of her speeches in a similarly disrespectful manner (I\u2019ve already won, I can check out now). I told their coach, he rolled his eyes and told me it\u2019s an ongoing problem with this student, I imagine the student got a bit of a lecture. So tell your coach about disrespectful behavior.\n\nI very much doubt the tournament would change a result or DQ a competitor for the behavior you described though.",

What I'd add is that this experience, while frustrating, actually makes you stronger. Learning to deliver your arguments clearly when opponents are trying to throw you off is a valuable skill that'll serve you well in future rounds.\n\nThe fact that you recovered in final focus and still delivered your points shows you've got good composure under pressure. Many debaters would have completely fallen apart after blanking during rebuttal, but you pushed through and finished the round.\n\nAlso worth remembering that teams who resort to obvious disrespect during your speech usually do it because they're worried about their own position. Confident teams with strong arguments don't need to rely on intimidation tactics.\n\nNext time this happens, use it as fuel. Think \"they're worried enough about what I'm saying that they're trying to put me off\" rather than \"they think I'm rubbish.\" It's actually a weird sort of compliment when you think about it that way.\n\nKeep your head up and keep debating.
