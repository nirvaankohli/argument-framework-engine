Now.. things like Kotlin do technically make your life a little better, but it's not by any huge margin. The reliability and ocean of knowledge / know-hows that are already present in the Java / C# ecosystem vastly outweighs whatever cons those languages have.\n\nAs for roadmap, I would *not* start with system architecture as that's unlikely to mean anything to juniors with &lt; 3 YoE. I'd learn by really understanding some coding patterns and principles like REST, 4 tiered architecture, DDD / Hex, separation of concerns, proper error handling, basic RESTful principles etc. Once I'm comfy with all that and can write a complex CRUD app on my own, then I'd probably start diving into some patterns on AWS along with YAML managers like terraform, argoCD etc.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people recommending Golang. I would agree that Golang is significantly easier, however there's no real reason to use it over Java. That's why the job openings for it are so small.",

It\u2019s so easy to read and build, without much fluff, that when dozens to hundreds of people work over many years it always remains easy to just get working.\n\nAt my company we use Go for backend and C# for front. The front end guys are always writing this stuff that you have to figure out for two hours, endless abstractions, fancy one liners, and so on.\n\nGo by comparison just doesn\u2019t lend towards that style and in some cases fights it. In the end it\u2019s just easy to work with.\n\nCode is not an asset, it\u2019s a liability. Plain code that works is the best option outside of deleting code, which is the best kind of coding.",
