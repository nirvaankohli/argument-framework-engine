I disagreed and said they were no longer human when they turn. His points were that they didn't change much physically, were basically undead humans, and that they were the same but insane. My points were that if they were human then you wouldn't need the word zombie, the fact that they change so much mentally, humans don't act that way unless you've gone mad, and the fact that you aren't the same anymore after turning. If you could offer new points, give your opinion, or say who is right it would be appreciated.",

Instead you remain what you are, and gain additional adaptions too.\n\nZombies are humans, they're just infected. The definition of human isn't contingent on how many bullets you can wear and keep ticking.\n\n(Edit: This law of monophilae and cladistics is what states as fact that birds are, in fact, dinosaurs, as they don't stop being what their ancestors were)",

I was like 10, but I'd earned my reptile merit badge in Scouts... \n\nI couldn't understand how tadpole changed from a fish to a frog considering their different evolutionary histories.. it all started because of an issue I had drawing their eyes.  Frogs had vertical slits, but fish eyes were round and without eyelids..... And when did frogs lose their gills?  When they became amphibians... ?  Since frogs layed fish eyes, did they keep the fish reproductive system?  \n\nDid a toad and a fish really love each one day, and that's where tadpoles come from?\n\nYea kids are fucking stupid, but life was hard pre-wikipedia days... I think I called a pet store and asked whatever guy happened to answered the phone... (who also happened to know the answer btw.)\n\nIt blew my mind when I learned that tadpoles are not fish, they're still fucking frogs, albeat in an early phase of their ribbity life cycle.  \n\nFrog eggs are premature frogs, tadpoles are juvenile frogs, adult frogs are adult frogs, and dead frogs are dead frogs.  They're all the same species....\n\nSoooooooo, I think the dead human is a dead human.  And the zombie has a relationship ship with the dead human body.  But it's inhabiting part of the body of a dead human like a hermit crab inhabits a part of a dead mollusk....",

Supernatural is magic, so 'don't gotta explain shit', and holds up less to investigation anyway, so is the weaker of the two premise, but this means we have to direct some of our scrutiny at the bio-zombies again instead.\n\nBio zombies are still WEARING the trappings of their meatbag hosts. So, technically, its an evolutionary symbiosis, like single-celled organisms forming colonies (an example that religious fundies REALLY need to grapple with when trying to dismiss evolution), so we'd call them a hybrid organism?",

This dictionary also suggests that, \"Zombies are not able to think and they are often shown as attacking and eating human beings.\" This supports the second argument as to become a human you need to have a majority of qualities, feeling and to be able to think.

      "text": "Well, if we are to come to a conclusion here, it is necessary to specify what kind of zombie we speak of, infected/viral or undead/reanimated.\n\nI think firstly it's safe to establish that, no matter what kind of zombie we're debating about, killing them is not a moral issue (if that's what your brother was getting at) since they're killing  and infecting everyone else. Unless being a zombie is actually good, in which case all should be converted to zombiism. Less world wars, that's for sure.\n\nAnyways, on to my points:\n\nUndead: okay so when you die, your consciousness is what's dying, your memories... everything that makes you human. Or at least leaving your mortal shell. The body is technically still \"human\" (as in, it's a human corpse) until it rots into dirt, however the mind is either that of the necromancer raising it up or no mind at all, just a flesh-eating organism incapable of human thought and emotion which, ultimately, makes us human. So I think it's safe to say that the Undead are no longer \"human\" as such, simply human bodies or corpses.\n\nInfected: Again, same basic principle; the body is human, but the mind/consciousness/\"soul\"/essence of the person no longer resides, leaving it just a shell of a human inhabited by some viral infection which is using the body as a host. There is also (as far as I know) no condition that those considered \"human\" have that exhibits zombie-like tendencies. No emotion, no reasoning or thought, perhaps even more stupid than animals. I don't think it's fair to call these zombies human either.\n\nThe only exception I'd say is Shaun of the Dead, where dead Nick Frost still plays videogames with Simon Pegg. He's more just had a paradigm shift into a cannibalistic sociopath, but definitely still human ;)",
